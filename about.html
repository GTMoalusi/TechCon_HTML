        <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
        <p>
          TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts in a
          local community center. Its founders envisioned a platform where
          innovative ideas could be shared, and professionals could connect and
          collaborate. Over the years, it grew steadily, attracting more
          speakers, attendees, and sponsors, transforming into the premier
          technology conference it is today.
        </p>
        <p>
          From its humble beginnings focusing on open-source software, TechCon
          expanded its scope to cover emerging technologies like AI, blockchain,
          and sustainable tech. Each year has marked a significant milestone in
          fostering technological advancement and community growth.
